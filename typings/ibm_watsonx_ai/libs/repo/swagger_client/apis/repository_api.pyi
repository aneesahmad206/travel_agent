        This method makes a synchronous HTTP request by default. To make an
        asynchronous HTTP request, please define a `callback` function
        to be invoked when receiving the response.
        >>> def callback_function(response):
        >>>     pprint(response)
        >>>
        >>> thread = api.repository_delete_function_with_http_info(id, callback=callback_function)

        :param callback function: The callback function
            for asynchronous request. (optional)
        :param str id: function identifier (required)
        :return: None
